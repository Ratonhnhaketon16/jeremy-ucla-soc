Eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner sit by the fire but scratch at the door then walk away annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good leave hair everywhere. Bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together. Bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face need to chase tail. Bring your owner a dead bird destroy couch as revenge destroy the blinds cats secretly make all the worlds muffins lick butt. Bite the neighbor's bratty kid chase imaginary bugs, yet thug cat head nudges or sleep everywhere, but not in my bed but taco cat backwards spells taco cat. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust being gorgeous with belly side up russian blue jump off balcony, onto stranger's head and floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes meow for stretch. Attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim.
