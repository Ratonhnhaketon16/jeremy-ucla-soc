		<p class = "Cats">"Cats are great animals because they don't require a lot of attention. But they are very tame, so therefore they are really easy pets to have."</p>

		<p class = "Basilisks">"Basilisks on the other hand are really cool, they may be mythical, but it still creates fear in the minds of the people."</p>

		<p class = "Panthers">"Panthers are just bigger and less tame versions of cats. If you grow with a cub however, they would not be hostile to you."</p>
